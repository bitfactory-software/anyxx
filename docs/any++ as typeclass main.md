\page main Any++, C++0x Concepts, Rust Traits, Haskell Type Classes

This Article shows, how the library Any++ has envolved into a type class system, and how it compares to C++0x Concepts, Rust traits, and Haskell type classes.


To illustrate the concept, we will use the "Hello World" of type classes, the "Monoid",
as an example.

Steve Dovney's work on "Concept Maps using C++23 Library Tech" clears the way for us
to show how Any++ can close the last usability gaps for Concept Maps and bring us a
good aproximisation of checked templates in C++23.

We will finish with a look into an onging ISO C++ proposal, which when accepted,
get us to full checked templates.
