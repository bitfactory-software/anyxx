\page main Any++, C++0x Concepts, Rust traits, Haskell type classes

This Article shows, how Any++ has envolved into a type class system, and how it compares to C++0x Concepts, Rust traits, and Haskell type classes.
To illustrate the concept, we will use the "Hello World" of type classes, the "Monoid", as an example.
We will see how close we are to checked templates in C++23 and that full checked templates are only one small(?) proposal away to get into C++29.
