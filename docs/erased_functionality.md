[^1]: How m_tables work:
    - Every `class` defining an `open_method::via_m_table` has an `m_table`.
    - Every `open_method::via_m_table` belongs to a domain.
    - Every `domain` has a unique index.
    - Every `open_method::via_m_table` has a unique index in its domain.
    - A pointer to the `m_table` is passed to the call of the `open_method`.
    - The function called is `m_table[domain_index][method_index]`.
    - Consider a 'domain' an analogy to an 'interface'.
